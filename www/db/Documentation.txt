		                 FAQ
		_____________________________________

A. How does it work?

	It monitors EventStreams to pick up new URL additions made by User:InternetArchiveBot
        across all Wikimedia projects.

B. How accurate?

	There are a number of issues related to EventStreams

		1. If an existing URL is changed to a new destination such as "http" to "https" 
                   it will be counted as a new URL. If the change is encoding-only such as 
                   "/" to "%2F" it will not be considered a new URL.

                2. If an article was 'imported' from one Wiki to another by a Wikipedia user (special process),
                   the bot is credited for the links it added in the original Wiki then imported to the new Wiki.
                   However, the bot did not actually edit the new Wiki and thus it's User Contributions page
                   does not show edits by the bot, these are marked in italic font in the table. In addition,
                   if the entire row is italic it means the bot is not active on the site and the second column
                   language id is marked with a grey box and not counted towards the total number of active sites.

		3. It does not monitor deletions. Thus if a URL is added and then deleted in
		   a subsequent edit, the URL is still considered added for counting purposes.

C. How to generate stats

For number of diffs 

ls | grep -E "^[0-9]{1,3}.txt" | xargs cat | awk '{if($7 > 0) {z++; print z ". https://" $1 ".wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=" $2}}' | tail

For number of links

ls | grep -E "^[0-9]{1,3}.txt" | xargs cat | awk '{if($8 > 0){k=k+int($8)}}END{print k}'
